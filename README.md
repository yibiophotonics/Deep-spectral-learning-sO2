# Deep-spectral-learning-oxygen saturation

Python (Keras) implementation of paper: 
Deep	spectral	learning	for	label-free	optical	imaging	oximetry	with	uncertainty	quantification. 
We provide models (a fully connected neural network and a convolutional neural network) with pre-trained weights, input spectra for model training, results of test data, statistical analysis, and reconsturction of en face maps of oxygen saturation & uncertainty.
